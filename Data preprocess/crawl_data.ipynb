      "Disorders specifically associated with stress are directly related to exposure to a stressful or traumatic event, or a series of such events or adverse experiences. For each of the disorders in this grouping, an identifiable stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. Although not all individuals exposed to an identified stressor will develop a disorder, the disorders in this grouping would not have occurred without experiencing the stressor. Stressful events for some disorders in this grouping are within the normal range of life experiences (e.g., divorce, socio-economic problems, bereavement). Other disorders require the experience of a stressor of an extremely threatening or horrific nature (i.e., potentially traumatic events). With all disorders in this grouping, it is the nature, pattern, and duration of the symptoms that arise in response to the stressful events—together with associated functional impairment—that distinguishes the disorders.\n",
      "Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.\n",
      "Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex PTSD) is a disorder that may develop following exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature, most commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible (e.g. torture, slavery, genocide campaigns, prolonged domestic violence, repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse). All diagnostic requirements for PTSD are met. In addition, Complex PTSD is characterised by severe and persistent 1) problems in affect regulation; 2) beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless, accompanied by feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the traumatic event; and 3) difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others. These symptoms cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.\n",

      "Disorders of bodily distress and bodily experience are characterised by disturbances in the person’s experience of his or her body. Bodily distress disorder involves bodily symptoms that the individual finds distressing and to which excessive attention is directed. Body integrity dysphoria involves a disturbance in the person’s experience of the body manifested by the persistent desire to have a specific physical disability accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration.\n",
      "Bodily distress disorder is characterised by the presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual and excessive attention directed toward the symptoms, which may be manifest by repeated contact with health care providers. If another health condition is causing or contributing to the symptoms, the degree of attention is clearly excessive in relation to its nature and progression. Excessive attention is not alleviated by appropriate clinical examination and investigations and appropriate reassurance. Bodily symptoms are persistent, being present on most days for at least several months. Typically, bodily distress disorder involves multiple bodily symptoms that may vary over time. Occasionally there is a single symptom—usually pain or fatigue—that is associated with the other features of the disorder. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation have at least some impact on the individual’s functioning (e.g. strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities).\n",
      "All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is excessive attention to distressing symptoms and their consequences, which may result in frequent medical visits, but the person is not preoccupied with the symptoms (e.g., the individual spends less than an hour per day focusing on them). Although the individual expresses distress about the symptoms and they may have some impact on his or her life (e.g., strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities), there is no substantial impairment in the person’s personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n",
      "All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is persistent preoccupation with the distressing symptoms and their consequences (e.g., the individual spends more than an hour a day thinking about them), typically associated with frequent medical visits. The person devotes much of his or her energy to focusing on the symptoms and their consequences. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation cause moderate impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., relationship conflict, performance problems at work, abandonment of a range of social and leisure activities).\n",
      "All definitional requirements of Bodily distress disorder are present. There is pervasive and persistent preoccupation with the symptoms and their consequences to the extent that these may become the focal point of the person’s life, typically resulting in extensive interactions with the health care system. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation cause serious impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., unable to work, alienation of friends and family, abandonment of nearly all social and leisure activities). The person’s interests may become so narrow as to focus almost exclusively on his or her bodily symptoms and their negative consequences.\n",

      "All definitional requirements for oppositional defiant disorder are met. This form of oppositional defiant disorder is characterised by prevailing, persistent angry or irritable mood that may be present independent of any apparent provocation. The negative mood is often accompanied by regularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the provocation. Chronic irritability and anger are characteristic of the individual’s functioning nearly every day, are observable across multiple settings or domains of functioning (e.g., home, school, social relationships), and are not restricted to the individual’s relationship with his/her parents or guardians. The pattern of chronic irritability and anger is not limited to occasional episodes (e.g., developmentally typical irritability) or discrete periods (e.g., irritable mood in the context of manic or depressive episodes).\n",

      "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is an acute illness, usually of preterm infants, due to pulmonary surfactant deficiency, developing within 4-6 hours of birth, and is characterised by respiratory distress (tachypnoea, intercostal and sternal retractions, expiratory grunt, and cyanosis) with abnormal chest radiograph showing diffuse reticulogranular densities and air bronchograms, evidence of reduced lung compliance and functional residual capacity, evidence of abnormal gas exchange (hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, cyanosis) of sufficient severity to require oxygen and/or continuous or intermittent positive pressure ventilatory support for more than 24 hours.\n",
